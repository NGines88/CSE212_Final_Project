# Coding with Data Structures
## Stacks, Linked Lists, and Trees

In this tutorial, you will learn the fundamentals of using the three data structures listed above. We will be using the Python programming language for this tutorial, but the concepts surrounding these structures apply to most other languages as well.

We will go over the purpose of each of these data structures, how to use them in code, and then give you an opportunity to practice using them.
